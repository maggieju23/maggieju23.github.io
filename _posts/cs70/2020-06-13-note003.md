### The Truth Behind Induction Hypothesis:

This will be in the lecture, in the note, everywhwere. But make sure you can write induction principle on your own and understand how this transforms into "proof by induction":

Formal definition:

Induction Principle: $$P(1) \wedge (P(n) \implies P(n+1)) \implies \forall n \in \mathbb{N} P(n)$$

Essentially, we can expand "$$P(n) \implies P(n+1)$$", as the following chain of implication is true:

$$ P(1) \implies P(2) \implies P(3) \implies P(4) ...$$

Since this chain of implication is true, if we know P(1) is True as well, then P(2) is True. Since P(2) True, then P(3) is True...

It is just like a sequence of domino tiles, we now know every P(n) is true!

This is formally why induction is true!

In fact, Induction Principle directly comes from "Well Ordering Principle" of integers, which is very nonempty subset of integers has a smallest or least element. In fact, you can prove "Well Ordering Principle" implies "Induction Principle".Hint:[Use proof by contradiction and consider the set $$n \in \mathbb{N} P(n)$$ is False]. I will leave this as a daily excercise to you! 

### Induction not only on Natural number:

Can you do induction some set other than natural number? Absolutely, for example, consider the set $$3\mathbb{Z}^{+}+1$$ := {$$k \in \mathbb{N} \| 3k + 1$$}

If we expand it out, it becomes {1,4,7,10,13,16 ...}

In order to do induction on this set, we need change our base case and induction hypothesis a little bit. We need to have $$P(1)$$ as base case and $$P(n) \implies P(n+3)$$ as induction hypothesis instead. Can you see why? I think this is already a big hint for you homework problem so I'll say no more. I'll explain more on this in the modular arithmetic chapter!
