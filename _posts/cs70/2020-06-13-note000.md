For all the student who wants to get an A and A+ in this class, my advice is that simply watch lecture and doing practice exam is not enough. In order to get A and A+, you need to truly understand the material. You need to teach yourself and make a habit of reading notes. If you are interested in math/ML field, learn to read note/textbook will benefit you so much and even beyound the benefit of the material of this class. Another good way to study is to discuss among peers and explain the concept to your friend. Here's some extra note I wrote for you to show that you truly understand the material. I love you all and wish you succeed!!

This is Kirara(雲母) from an old school Anime called InuYasha. It isn't my favorite anime but she is probably animal.
