### Proposition are functions that takes in some input and output True or False:

For example, we can define the proposition "x is greater than 5" as $$P(x)$$. If we replace x with 4, it will make the statement becomes "4 is greater than 5", a wrong statement. If we replace x with 6, it will make the statement becomes "6 is greater than 5", a true statement. Wow, it's just like a function in python :

$$
P(x)= \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
      True & x > 5\\
      False & x \leq 5\\
\end{array} 
\right. 
$$

Similarly, "x is less than 6" can be written as $$Q(x)$$ such that:

$$
Q(x)= \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
      True & x < 6\\
      False & x \geq 6\\
\end{array} 
\right. 
$$

Further compounding proposition with logic will also give functions, for example:

$$
Q(x) \wedge P(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
      True & 5< x < 6\\
      False & Otherwise\\
\end{array} 
\right. 
$$

Here's today's exercise: Prove the above expression is correct. Hint: use Truth Table (because this is the only way you learnt so far to prove things)
### What exactly is Universal Quantifier $$\forall$$ and $$\exists$$:

The $$\forall$$ is a sequence of "and" and $$\exists$$ is a sequence of "or". Although this is in your note, I cannot stress it more. For example, we can denote the proposition "x is non-negative" as P(x). And what's the statement "All natural number are non-negative" in propositional logic? It is

$$(\forall n \in \mathbb{N}) P(n)$$, which is equivalently as $$P(0) \wedge P(1) \wedge P(2) \wedge P(3) ...$$

Similarly, the statement "for any real number x, there is natural number greater than x" can be written as $$(\forall x \in  \mathbb{R} ) (\exists n \in \mathbb{N}) x < n$$, which can be expanded as $$(\forall x \in \mathbb{R}) (x<1) \vee (x<2) \vee (x<3) \vee (x<4) ...$$
This is one of the most important theorem in anlysis, which is probably be the first thing you learn if you take Math 104. Notice I expaned $$\exists n \in \mathbb{N} $$ using the "or" operator "$$\vee$$", but I cannot expand $$(\forall x \in  \mathbb{R} )$$, this is simply because I cannot iterate through all the real number. Formally, real numbers are "uncountable" and we will learn about this later.
